Settling down, Gautam Gambhir played his shots (he achieved top score for India with 75 from 54 balls including 8 fours and 2 sixes). On the other end, Yuvraj Singh was caught out from a Umar Gul delivery to end the 63-run partnership. After MS Dhoni was bowled by Gul for 6, the innings slowed between over 14 to 18.[15] Rohit Sharma made some late-order hitting which brought India to 157 for 5 in the twenty overs. For Pakistan, Gul was the best of the bowlers as he took three wickets while Asif and Sohail Tanvir each took a wicket. In the run chase, Pakistan lost Hafeez in the first over while Akmal was bowled by an in-swinger from R. P. Singh. After a twenty-one run-over from S. Sreesanth, Imran Nazir was run out Robin Uthappa on 31, which started a brief collapse with the wickets of Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik and Yasir Arafat putting Pakistan to 77 for 6.[15] Misbah-ul-Haq remained strong at the other end with support from the tail-enders, and reached within thirteen runs of the target; however, he lost his wicket, with the gamble of going over short-fine leg ending in a Sreesanth catch. This resulted in India winning by five runs.[15] The pick of the bowlers was Irfan Pathan and R. P. Singh, who each collected three wickets; Joginder Sharma and S.

On a memorable night at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Indian cricket team, led by the impeccable Virat Kohli, scores an impressive victory against Pakistan in the T20 match. On a charged evening in Melbourne, a cricketing story unfolded with the Indian team rejoicing in an impressive victory against Pakistan. Leading the team to triumph was none other than the modern titan of Indian cricket, Virat Kohli. With India in a precarious position at 31 for 4, the chase to reach the target of 160 could be considered nothing less than daunting. However, Kohli staying true to his moniker, 'Chase Master', marshalled the batting order with his impeccable skill set. Assisting him in this pursuit was Hardik Pandya, who delivered a critical 40 off 37 balls, contributing to the power-packed partnership of 113 for the fifth wicket. The game saw a turning point in the 19th over when Kohli struck back-to-back sixes off Haris Rauf's delivery. 
    These strikes elucidated Kohli's international standing as one of the world's best chasers, as acknowledged by the Indian team captain Rohit Sharma. Pandya, unfortunately, got holed out off Mohammed Nawaz's bowling in the last ball of the 19th over. The game proceeded with 14 runs required off three balls when a welcomed respite came for the Indian team. Nawaz's unjustified full toss that got dispatched for a six was declared a no ball, and India found a firm footing. After Dinesh Karthik got stumped by Mohammed Rizwan, Ravichandran Ashwin contributed to a decisive boundary. MCG roared with echoes of 'Chak De India' as Kohli, accepting the audience validation, took a moment to celebrate India's supremacy in a global event.`},

It was the first time a One Day International final match required a Super Over, and subsequently the first time it had been decided by a boundary count. The match has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic in the history of the sport, with some analysts describing it as the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes hit a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket, bringing their score to 233/8.From the third-last ball of the final over, Stokes drove the ball into mid-wicket. Guptill fielded the ball and threw it back to the striker's end as Stokes was returning to complete a second run; however, as Stokes dived for the crease, the ball deflected off his bat and to the boundary behind the wicket, resulting in four runs being added to the two that Stokes had run.[18] The final two deliveries went for a run each, but England lost their last two wickets going for a second run each time." },

    “Can’t move, but hits a six over third man. He’s a freak, different universe. Australian captain Pat Cummins has been around for a long time to know Glenn Maxwell is a ‘freak’. But even then, as he watched the ‘greatest ODI innings’, the Australia captain could scarcely believe what had transpired.Cummins wasn’t the only one left with that feeling.Batting first, Afghanistan had piled on 291/5 and then reduced Australia to 91/7 by the 19th over of the second innings. It was then that Maxwell took over and put Afghan batters to the sword despite cramping severely throughout the innings. He collapsed to the ground at times, and could only powerwalk his way through singles. But so dominant was his batting that his partner in the middle, Pat Cummins, only needed to score 12 runs off 68 balls.
    Maxwell scored 201 off 128 balls with 21 fours and 10 sixes. He earned a second life when batting at 33 after Mujeeb Ur Rahman dropped a sitter at short fine. ` },

Back on January 19, 2021, India beat Australia for the first time in a Test match at the Gabba in Brisbane. With the series level at 1-1, the visitors had a tough task at hand as Australia have always dominated at the venue in Brisbane. From facing multiple injury concerns to not having Virat Kohli as their skipper, India had their fair share of issues before the last Test of the series. It seemed that Australia would steamroll India without having to break a sweat. After opting to bat first, Australia scored 369 in 115.2 overs on the back of Marnus Labuschagne’s knock of 108. Tim Paine scored 50 while Steve Smith, Matthew Wade and Cameron Green scored 36, 45 and 47 respectively. T Natarajan, Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar picked up three wickets apiece. India conceded a slender, yet crucial lead of 33 runs after being bowled out for 336 in 111.4 overs. Sundar and Thakur made 62 and 67 respectively to help India recover from 186 for six. The duo put on 123 runs for the seventh wicket to bail their team out of a precarious position. Josh Hazlewood was the star Australian bowler after he picked up five wickets for 57 runs in 24.4 overs. Australia scored 294 runs in their second innings and set India a target of 328 to chase down. Steve Smith scored 55 and was the top-scorer for the Aussies. Mohammed Siraj picked up five wickets while Thakur accounted for four scalps.Thereafter, India chased down the target in 97 overs to make history. They lost the early wicket of Rohit Sharma in their run-chase, but Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a knock of 91, laced with eight fours and two sixes.
    Cheteshwar Pujara made 56 runs off 211 balls to hold one end up. Then it was the turn of Rishabh Pant to show his class and take India past the finish line in the closely-fought contest. The southpaw stayed unbeaten on 89 runs off 138 balls as India went past the finish line in the third and final session of the fifth day’s play.
    Three years later, the win remains as one of India's greatest. While other teams from the subcontinent have found it tough to win a Test in Australia, India won successive Test series in their backyard. `},

Ajinkya Rahane (27 off 13) and Ambati Rayudu (19 off 8) helped CSK chase down 171 from 15 overs in a rain-shortened IPL final.Earlier, Sai Sudharsan had put on a stunning show on the big stage with a splendid 96 off 47 balls, ably supported by Wriddhiman Saha (54 off 39) and Shubman Gill 39 (20) to help GT post a mammoth 214/4 before rain forced the match to be shortened to 15 overs.  Chasing 171 from 15 overs, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway got CSK off to a flier. Ruturaj got off the mark in style with a lovely square drive for a four off the third ball of the innings from Mohd. Shami. But soon after rain stopped play and the match was reduced to 15-overs with CSK having to chase a revised target of 171 runs. The revised playing conditions meant the Powerplay was reduced to four overs while a bowler could bowl a maximum of three overs.As play resumed, Gaikwad cracked another four in the unfinished first over as he pulled one through backward square leg to make it 10 runs off it. Devon Conway then got going straightaway as he lofted one over extra cover for a six off Hardik Pandya in the second over and then whipped one to fine leg for a four. He took the attack to Shami in the next over, smacking two more fours to accumulate 11 off it.Hardik Pandya introduced Rashid Khan early into the attack but the CSK batters went after him straightaway, cracking a couple of fours and a six to take CSK to 52/0 at the end of the Powerplay (4th over).Noor Ahmad bowled a good first over, giving away just six but Josh Little's first over went for 14 as Conway thumped a pull over deep mid-wicket off the last ball of the sixth over.The impressive Noor got the much-needed breakthrough for GT as he broke the 74-run opening stand by sending back Gaikwad (26 off 16) via a wrong'un. CSK then sent out Shivam Dube as their Impact Player, at No.3, replacing Matheesha Pathirana. Noor struck again off the final ball of the over to have Conway (47 off 25) caught at long off to peg CSK back.Ajinkya Rahane arrived and got going in style with two exquisite sixes off Josh Little to make it a 16-run over. Noor Ahmad though balanced things out with another brilliant over, giving away just five as he finished with impressive figures of 3-0-17-2.Rahane got the momentum back again with a couple of fours off Rashid to bring the equation down to 60 needed off 30. Mohit Sharma arrived into the attack in the 11th over and struck straightaway to get the crucial wicket of Rahane (27 off 13), caught a deep point off a slower one. The GT pacer bowled a fantastic over and gave away just six as the equation came to 53 needed off 24 balls. Rashid bowled four good balls, giving away just three in the 12th over but Dube finally found the middle of the bat as he thumped two sixes in a row to end the over on a high and amass 15 runs. Rayudu, playing his last IPL match, joined the party as he smacked the first ball of the 13th over from Mohit over long off for a six and then cracked a four off the next ball through extra cover, then thumped another six but Mohit hit back hard to have him caught and bowled off the next ball and then got the huge wicket of MS Dhoni off he next ball as he had him caught at extra cover. The roller-coaster saw 17 runs scored and two wickets taken as the equation came down to 21 needed off 12.Shami bowled a very good penultimate over to give away just eight. With 13 needed off the last over, the experienced Mohit nailed four yorkers upfront and gave away just three runs. With 10 needed off two, the tables turned again as Mohit missed his marker and Jadeja smacked a six over long on. With four needed off the last ball, Mohit bowled a low full toss down the leg side and Jadeja swiped it to fine leg for a four to win it for CSK and spark wild celebrations.` },

The Windies of 1983 were cricketing demigods, and defeating them seemed an insurmountable task. Yet, Kapil's Devils defied the odds, displaying a brand of cricket that blended skill with tenacity, and flair with determination. After losing the toss, India was asked to bat first against a West Indies team that arguably boasted the world's best bowling attack. Sunil Gavaskar, who had a generally unsuccessful tournament, got dismissed early on for two. A partnership between Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Mohinder Amarnath took India past the 50 mark, before the former was taken lbw by Marshall. Amarnath was then bowled by Holding for 26, and only eleven more runs were made before Yashpal Sharma fell. Kapil Dev, the Indian captain, took 8 balls to reach 15, but was caught off the bowling of Larry Gomes; leaving India at 110/5. Kirti Azad didn't score any runs. Roger Binny was caught on two, while Sandeep Patil made 27 to get India to 153/8. All-rounder Madan Lal soon followed for 17, and 10th wicket partnership made 22 runs before Michael Holding bowled Syed Kirmani for 14. India were thus bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs, which many thought was easily reachable. Andy Roberts had claimed three wickets, and Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Larry Gomes took two wickets each. Sandeep Patil and Madan Lal saved the game to get the team past the 150-run mark at a critical point in the match where India scored 183 runs. After India was bowled out for just 183 runs, Kapil Dev told everyone to fight for every single run. The first over by Kapil Dev was a Maiden. If it also wasn't for Kapil Dev's 175, India wouldn't have made it to the 1983 CWC final.
    The West Indies set out to chase the low target of 184 but lost an early wicket when Balwinder Sandhu famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge. Desmond Haynes and Viv Richards, batted smoothly past 50, but both batsmen were removed by the bowling of Madan Lal, leaving the West Indies at 57/3. Lal soon claimed a third wicket – that of Gomes – and Dev then caught West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, leaving the West Indies at 66/5. Ten runs later, Faoud Bacchus was removed by Sandhu. Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall put on a partnership of 43 runs before Mohinder Amarnath dismissed them on 119 and 124 respectively. Soon, Kapil Dev trapped Andy Roberts for an lbw, and Amarnath got Michael Holding out LBW. The West Indies were thus all out for 140, and India had won their maiden Cricket World Cup by 43 runs. The Indian bowlers had completed one of the biggest upsets in cricket history, defeating the previously invincible West Indies. Both Amarnath and Lal had taken three wickets for India, while Sandhu claimed two. Amarnath was awarded the Man of the Match for his all-round performance.[8] There was no "Man of the Series" award in 1983.`},

He made 114 runs from 106 balls, which included twelve fours and three sixes. After his dismissal, the other Pakistani batsmen kept the score ticking over. Mohammad Hafeez plundered 57 not out from 37 balls, including four fours and three sixes. Pakistan eventually finished on 338/4 – their second-highest ODI score against India – after 50 overs.

In the third over, Virat Kohli was dropped in the slips for just five runs but caught the next ball by Shadab Khan at point.[26] Their poor form continued until, in the middle of the innings, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja managed a rapid 80-run partnership prior to Pandya being run-out.

    When Shane Watson stalks in from the slips to lean in and spit those words at Wahab Riaz, does he know? Does he have any bloody idea, what he is really doing to Wahab, and 90 minutes later, to himself? Australia had, at one stage, spoken in team meetings about easing off Kevin Pietersen verbally. "It fires him up," was Brett Lee's reasoning. They had not had this meeting about Wahab. When Mitchell Starc beats his edge with an outswinging yorker in the 39th over, the bowler slithers forward. He tells the batsman: "It's the white thing, you have to hit it." Wahab, already cranky at another middle-order meltdown from his team-mates, follows Starc down the pitch. He seethes at the bowler, complains to the umpires. Next over, James Faulkner throws Wahab a stare. Brad Haddin, running close to the stumps to collect a return throw, sticks his own verbal shiv in Wahab's side. Watson's sledge is only one of many, but it's Watson's sledge Wahab remembers. Before the end of the night, Watson would know best of all, this is not a man worth ruffling; that Wahab's blood boils when you turn up the heat.Eighteen overs and an innings break later, it is Wahab with the white thing in his hands. Third ball, he rushes David Warner into an uppercut, which settles in the palms of third man Rahat Ali. Tenth ball, Michael Clarke arches his creaking back and fends the white thing to Sohaib Maqsood at short leg.

    The first ball to Watson would have flattened the batsman's grille. He dips beneath it with only a little discomfort, but for Wahab, ducking is tantamount to submission. He gets in Watson's face, claps him sarcastically. The next ball is 150kph, Watson dare not play.The next over is even more intense. Wahab is an inferno. The white thing is a meteor. Watson goes through series of evasive full-body spasms. His back and limbs are aping the shape of half the alphabet, but his mouth can form no words now. In the stands, 35,516 people all smell leather, voices hoarse, fidgeting, pumping fists from the edge of their seats. In the slips, Haris Sohail's face contorts at the climax of each delivery, sometimes with glee, other times with desperation. On occasion his eyes are filled with fear. Is he afraid for Watson?

    Steven Smith, who is bending space-time to appear in a parallel universe from his partner, routinely takes a single early in the overs that follow and coolly observes the combat from the best vantage point in the world. Does he feel the heat pouring off Wahab? Is he enjoying the view?
    
    All through the match, the cricket had not failed to be interesting. This spell is transcendental. Of the tens of thousands in the ground, there is only one protagonist, and one victim, but the cricket so good, all are drawn in. Wahab's anger is felt as keenly as Watson's timidity. So bent is Wahab on embarrassing Watson, he taunts him after every ball.
    
    In one over, he does it so many times, it's as if Wahab rides a conveyor belt from the bowling crease into Watson's personal space. In the crowd, nothing of their exchange is heard, but its details are intimately understood. The Adelaide Oval playing surface covers acres of land. The stands themselves are vast and high. But in those moments, it's as if the whole stadium exists in the burning space between these two men."When I was batting Watson just came up to me and said, 'Are you holding a bat?' And that was going through my mind," Wahab later said. "I let him know that even he is having the bat, but he couldn't touch the ball. I know that nowadays, he's not good on the short ball. It was a plan of myself that we discussed in the team meeting."Eventually, Watson is defeated. Having ducked, arched and hopped, he is eventually humiliated into playing a hook shot off the first ball of Wahab's fifth over. Australian crowds so often scream insults at foreign fielders lining up high catches, but in the seconds this top-edged ball hung in the air, the wind's rustling through the trees at the Cathedral End was heard in perfect silence. When Rahat spilt the simple chance, 35,000 yelped - more in relief than frustration. A sheepish Watson is avoiding gazes at the non-striker's end. A disbelieving Wahab is keeled over, mid pitch.

    In the limp finish, an hour later, Australia cruise to the semi-final with six wickets in hand and 97 balls remaining. On the scoreboard, Wahab's figures read 9-0-54-2. Watson has 64 not out from 66. Few will remember in years to come, the ins and outs; that Pakistan had been bowled out for 213.But few will forget the theatre, and the unbridled, oscillating emotion of this spell. Tattooed into their nerves will be the night a fast bowler filled a stadium with his fury; the half-hour their collective pulses raced in sync with a batsman's heart.` },

    `, story:`Pakistan brought to an end India's near-three-decade domination of them in the world stage, embarrassing their arch-rivals by 10 wickets in the Super 12 stage of the T20 World Cup.Intent on breaking their the run of losses, Pakistan restricted India to 151 for seven after electing to field in the T20 showpiece's blockbuster game.Pakistan then made light work of the target of 152, completing the win with 13 balls to spare. Skipper Babar Azam stroked his way to 68 while his opening partner, Mohammad Rizwan, smashed 79 as the Indian bowlers struggled to contain the two batters.
    Earlier, captain Virat Kohli led from the front with a half-century as India recovered from a disastrous start to post a challenging total.
    Besides Kohli's 49-ball 57, Rishabh Pant slammed 39 in 30 deliveries.
    Sent into bat after the coin landed in favour of Pakistan skipper Babar Azam at the toss, India were off to the worst possible start as they lost both their prolific openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul within three overs with just six runs on the board.
    Doing most of the initial damage was the lanky left-arm pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi (3/31 in 4 overs), who had Rohit trapped in front of the wicket for a duck and then bowled Rahul after the batsman had run three singes.` },

His unbeaten 135 handed England the most unlikely of victories, by one wicket, in the third Test at Headingley, allowing them to level the series at 1-1.
    In one of the most thrilling finishes imaginable - well, since England's World Cup triumph last month with, you guessed it, Stokes, front and centre - he and Jack Leach stood up against the odds and steered their side to their highest successful run chase in Tests, two days after they had been humbled for 67 in their first innings and were then set 359 to win.Numerous times Australia threatened to take the final wicket they needed for a victory that had seemed inevitable, only to fluff their lines repeatedly.
    Stokes was dropped on 116 when he sent a top edge off Pat Cummins towards third man, where Marcus Harris got his hands to it but couldn't hold on. Australia then wasted a review - which would come back to haunt them - when Cummins rapped Leach on the pad and the DRS confirmed the ball had pitched well outside leg.
    When Stokes just cleared the man on the rope for a six off Nathan Lyon, the crowd went wild and England needed just two more to win. Two balls later, Leach should have been run out after going for a non-existent single, but Lyon fumbled as he tried to gather the throw from backward point. Stokes should have been out lbw attempting to slog-sweep the very next ball, which was pitching on middle and leg and shown by Hawk-Eye to be hitting the stumps, but with no reviews left, Australia could do nothing.The hosts had dared to dream when they resumed on a hot summer's day at 156 for 3 with Joe Root unbeaten on 75 and Stokes locked and loaded having faced 50 balls for his 2 not out.
    Cue the possibility. These two batsmen at the crease - Root with a point to ram home after going some way to answering critics of his batting, captaincy and combination of both, and Stokes with a fifty and a Man-of-the-Match century to his name in the previous two Tests - were fully capable of bringing England within reach of the 203 runs still needed to clinch victory.
    Cue the probability. Australia's attack, while frustrated on the third afternoon, had kept the pressure on and, with the second new ball due after eight overs on day four, England faced a big task just to navigate the morning, let alone chase down the target. That became even more unlikely when Root fell, having added just two runs, to a brilliant slips catch from David Warner - his sixth of the match - off the bowling of Lyon in the sixth over of the day.
    Stokes and Jonny Bairstow swung the probability back in England's favour with a defiant, and threatening, 86-run partnership. Their union was broken when Bairstow, on 36, attempted to cut Josh Hazlewood but guided the ball to Marnus Labuschagne at second slip.Cue the impossibility. Stokes' knock, which included 11 fours and eight sixes, also saw him farm the strike expertly, while England No. 11 Leach deserved huge plaudits for holding his nerve in a 76-run partnership with Stokes off 62 balls, to which Leach contributed 1 off 17. Only once in the history of Test cricket - actually only a few months ago, in Durban - has a last-wicket pair scored more to secure victory.
    Stokes had looked like running out of partners. Jos Buttler, initially called through and then sent back by Stokes, was run out to a direct his from Travis Head, Chris Woakes chipped Hazlewood straight to Matthew Wade at short extra cover, Jofra Archer holed out after a brief cameo and Stuart Broad was out lbw to a James Pattinson yorker.As Stokes neared his century, Hazlewood - who was one wicket away from claiming 10 for the match - returned to the attack. Stokes proceeded to take 19 off the over, bringing up his ton with a four hammered through wide long-on, and following up with consecutive sixes.
    Stokes admitted there were moments when he wasn't part of the action that he couldn't watch. Leach levelled the scores with a single off Cummins and when Stokes brought up the win on the next ball, flaying Cummins through the covers to the boundary, he let out an almighty roar, arms outstretched as Leach ran to embrace him like the saviour he was.
    It seemed like so long ago that Stokes had toiled with the ball for 24.2 overs to claim 3 for 56 in Australia's second innings, when Labuschagne top-scored for the tourists for the third time in as many innings with 80. It made Stokes' feats with the bat all the more remarkable.` },

This particular series between India and Australia is on the most cherished bilateral series for the Indian fans. It was an enthralling series decider and Rohit Sharma truly turned up on the occasion as the current India skipper went on to smash the first of his three ODI double centuries. It remains one of the most memorable moments in the history of Indian cricket.
    Hitman's performance was nothing short of extraordinary. He faced 158 balls and scored a staggering 209 runs, including 12 fours and record 16 sixes. This was not just his maiden double century in ODIs, but this score also continues to remain the highest individual ODI score by any batsman against Australia.

The hosts handed India their lowest ever Test score and went on to win the Adelaide Test by 8 wickets, leading the four-match series 1-0 at the time. The visitors were in a strong position and were leading by 62 runs on Day 3 into the second innings, however, the Tim Paine led side cruised past the Indian line-up, with Josh Hazlewood claiming a superb fifer.
    The previous lowest score for India was 42 runs against England at Lord’s in 1974. Skipper Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bat first on a bright sunny day in Adelaide. The visitors were handed their first jolt in the second ball of the Test as Mitchell Starc bowled out Prithvi Shaw for a duck.
    Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara held on before the opener was removed for 17. Pujara and Kohli built a strong foundation for India, with the skipper chipping in with a strong 74. Pujara (43) and Rahane (42) helped with handy runs before Starc and Pat Cummins cleaned the house, with India being bowled out for 244.Jasprit Bumrah gave the hosts their first blow by removing Matthew Wade for 8, with Joe Burns following suit after being trapped by the seamer. Marnus Labuschagne (47) and skipper Paine (73) were the only batters putting runs on the board as Ravichandran Ashwin 4/55, Umesh Yadav 3/40 and Bumrah 2/52 bundled out the hosts for 191, taking a lead of 53 runs.
    India resumed Day 3 with 9/1 and had a 62-run lead, however, what followed after was pure carnage. Nightwatchman Bumrah was removed for 2. Cummins then dismissed Pujara for a duck. India were trapped early, reeling at 15/3. The visitors were left stunned and to add more misery, Hazlewood claimed Agarwal’s wicket, with India’s score reading 15/4.
    Rahane lasted four deliveries as the vice-captain was removed for a duck by Hazlewood. Skipper Kohli scored four runs, however, it was not meant to be as Cummins dismissed the Indian captain and the score read 19/6.Hanuma Vihari scored 8, Saha and Yadav 4 each, which saw India being bowled out for 36 runs. Shami had to retire hurt after being struck by Cummins. Hazlewood registered figures of 5/8 while Cummins claimed 4/21. A dark day for India in their Test cricket history.
    Australia comfortably reached the lead as Joe Burns smashed 51 off 63 balls, Wade slamming 33 runs as Australia 93/2. The Aussies won the pink ball Test by 8 wickets and took a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.` },

India beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the final match of the tournament as Karthik's flat-six off the last ball of the match took the Rohit Sharma-led side home. In the final, Bangladesh had scored a challenging 166 in their allotted 20 overs. In response, Team India found themselves reeling at 98 for the loss of four wickets. The wicket of Manish Pandey in the 18th over and Vijay Shankar's sluggish innings only added to the pressure as the required run-rate increased.With 34 runs still needed of the last two overs, in walked Karthik and bludgeoned the Bangladesh bowling attack. The wicket-keeper batsman hammered the first three balls to the boundary as India scored 22 runs from the penultimate over.
    On the last ball when Men in Blue needed five runs, Karthik smashed a flat six over extra cover to hand India a victory not many could imagine. His eight-ball knock included two fours and three sixes and he was adjudged Man of the Match` },

But as luck would have it, it was on India's side 22 years ago in the NatWest Trophy final against the hosts England at Lord's. At 146/5, chasing 326 would have looked a far cry but it soon came all together for India in the last 25 overs set up by a brilliant 121-run partnership between Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif with the latter staying unbeaten on 87 to take his side home despite another collapse in the last few overs.However, the image of that match and the final and the win in every fan's mind and memory that is stuck is captain Soiurav Ganguly removing his shirt and waving it off at the iconic Lord's balcony in a way to give it back to Andrew Flintoff, who had done a similar thing. However, now Rajeev Shukla, the then Indian team manager and the current BCCI vice-president, has revealed that Ganguly wanted every member of the team to take his short off. However, Shukla and Sachin Tendulkar, another senior member of the team didn't agree to Ganguly's request.Speaking on 'Unfiltered by Samdish', Shukla said, "My blood pressure was rising and even took medicine for it. Me and Sourav were sitting next to each other and Sourav, who was the captain said to me, 'Rajeev, why is it just with me that we win all the games in the league stage and we lose the final? Why does it happen only with me?
    "Then he was like 'Only 52 runs are remaining and so many deliveries are left, chase is possible.' Then I told him, if it's possible then send the message to keep rotating the scorecard. 
    "And soon we found ourselves on the brink of a victory. Then Sourav Ganguly came up to me and suggested that the whole team should take their shirts off because he was going to. So, I and even Sachin Tendulkar said that don't involve the whole team, it doesn't look nice, it's a gentleman's game."But Sourav was adamant, so I told him that only he could go ahead with it," Shukla added.
    India required 58 runs in 48 balls with Kaif and Harbhajan Singh in the middle and the former smashed a six off Ronnie Irani's first delivery of the 43rd over. Harbhajan hit a six in the next as the duo kept the scorecard ticking with a boundary here or 5-6 singles there to bring the team to the brink, needing 14 off the last 18 balls. However, Flintoff had other ideas as he dismissed Harbhajan and Anil Kumble in the very same over to peg India further back. But, Kaif kept it cool to take India home with three balls remaining.` },
